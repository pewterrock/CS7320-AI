    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a simulator environment for an automatic vacuum cleaner robot, a set of different reflex agent programs, and perform a comparison study for cleaning a single room. Focus on the __cleaning phase__ which starts when the robot is activated and ends when the last dirty square is cleaned. Someone else will take care of the agent program needed to navigate back to the charging station after the room is clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PEAS description of the cleaning phase\n",
    "\n",
    "__Performance Measure:__ Each action costs 1 energy unit. The performance is measured as the sum of the energy units used to clean the whole room.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Environment:__ A room with $n \\times n$ squares where $n = 5$. Dirt is randomly placed on each square with probability $p = 0.2$. For simplicity, you can assume that the agent knows the size and the layout of the room (i.e., it knows $n$). To start, the agent is placed on a random square.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Actuators:__ The agent can `clean` the current square or move to an adjacent square by going `north`, `east`, `south`, or `west`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sensors:__ Four bumper sensors, one for north, east, south, and west; a dirt sensor reporting dirt in the current square.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The agent program for a simple randomized agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent program is a function that gets sensor information (the current percepts) as the arguments. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dictionary with boolean entries for the for bumper sensors `north`, `east`, `west`, `south`. E.g., if the agent is on the north-west corner, `bumpers` will be `{\"north\" : True, \"east\" : False, \"south\" : False, \"west\" : True}`.\n",
    "* The dirt sensor produces a boolean.\n",
    "\n",

    "The average cost per square is a good performance metric to show how efficient the robot vaccums are in the environment. The average cost per square for the model-based reflex agent stays around the same for any size of room. We can also see that the cost per square increases for the randomized and simple reflex agents as the room size increases. These observations indicate that the model-based reflex agent's cost is proportional to the number of squares in the room, while the cost for the randomized and simple reflex agents are more complex. For very large rooms, the memory for storing state model-based reflex agent can be worth the cost. If the robots operate on batteries, the randomized robot vacuum would likely need to be charged before finishing cleaning of a larger room."

All three implementations would clean the room eventually, but the model-based reflex agent would still clean the room the fastest. Since the model-based agent begins cleaning once it reaches the top-right corner of the room, it would still be able to start navigating the room square-by-square until it has navigated the entire room.  \n",

Once the model-based reflex agent finds a corner where the north and west bumpers are activated, it may not find the true north-west corner. Also, the model-based reflex agent is only able to travel east, west, or south, so it would never reach any of the northern squares that it would missed. If there were any dirty squares that it missed, the robot would continually travel east and west in the south-most row it found, and would only stop once the max_steps is met.  \n",

Since the only way to clean the whole space is for the robot to find and traverse a hallway, the amount of time  that it takes to clean the room would depend on how narrow and long a spaces between rooms is.

Since the robot cannot travel north once it has started cleaning, it will miss any of the dirty tiles that it skipped. If it missed dirty tiles, the agent would continually travel east and west in the south-most row it found, and would only stop once the max_steps is met.

    "### How the agents react to obstacles in the environment  \n",
    "  \n",
    "I added obstacles to our environment by changing the grid to storing an integer instead of boolean values. A value of '0' represents a clean square with no obstacles. A value of '1' represents a dirty square with no obstacles. A value of '2' represents a square with obstacles. In this example, 10% of the total squares have obstacles added, with 20% being dirty. I also added another metric feature that shows how many rooms were cleaned during a simulation, in order to show if the agent finished cleaning or hit the maximum number of steps.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We can see in our results that the randomized and simple reflex agent performed better than the model-based reflex agent. This is because the model-based reflex agent hit the maximum number of steps almost every time. For the 5x5 square, the randomized and simple reflex agents cleaned 95% of the rooms completely, while the model-based reflex agent was only able to clean 44%. For the 10x10 square, the model-based reflex agent was only able to completely clean 1%, while the other agents cleaned 100%. Finally, for the 100x100 square, the model-based reflex agent didn't clean a single room, while the other agents cleaned 60%.\n",

    "### Improving the agent's handling of obstacles  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A fullproof way of cleaning the room (besides squares blocked-in by obstacles and walls) is for the robot to perform a breadth-first search across all of the squares, recording the location of each square visited. The location of the agent would be the position relative to the starting point. The nodes of the search tree would be based on the bumper sensors. If a bumper is set to \"False\", then a new node is added in the direction of the bumper. Eventually every square would be visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest downside to this approach is the amount of memory used. For increasingly large rooms, the amount of space able to be stored might be too large for a robot vacuum. However, for a 100x100 room, this robot should function well. There would certainly be some more efficient algorithms, but this would most likely clean the whole room faster than both of the other agents.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## More advanced tasks to think about\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think about these:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Unknown environment with obstacles:__ Implement an agent for an environment where the agent does not know how large the environment is (we assume it is rectangular), where it starts or where the obstacles are. An option would be to always move to the closest unchecked/uncleaned square.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Utility-based agent:__ Change the environment, so each square has a fixed probability of getting dirty again. We assume the agent has learned this information over time. For the implementation, we give this information to the agent as a 2-dimensional array of probabilities  Cleaning one dirty square produces a utility of 1. Implement a utility-based agent that maximizes the expected utility over one full charge which lasts for 10000 time steps. This is very tricky!"
